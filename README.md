# CNN-Based-Post-Processing-Compensator
# Multi-Channel RDN Post-Processing Compensator

This repository contains the implementation of a **multi-channel post-processing module** based on the [RDN (Residual Dense Network)](https://github.com/yjn870/RDN-pytorch).  
It is designed to compensate for compression-induced distortions in intermediate feature maps for machine vision tasks.

## Features

- Adapted RDN model to support multi-channel input/output.
- Designed specifically for post-processing in **Feature Coding for Machine (FCM)** pipelines.
- Compatible with PyTorch.

## Usage

    from .models import RDN\
    from .fctm_compensator import fctm_compensator\
    from .two_channels_models import Two_Channels_RDN\
    from .two_channels_compensator import two_channels_compensator\
    from .three_channels_models import Three_Channels_RDN\
    from .three_channels_compensator import three_channels_compensator\
    x["data"] = fctm_compensator(x["data"])\
    x["data"] = two_channels_compensator(x["data"])\
    x["data"] = three_channels_compensator(x["data"])\
