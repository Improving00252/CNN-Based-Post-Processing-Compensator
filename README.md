# CNN-Based-Post-Processing-Compensator
# Multi-Channel RDN Post-Processing Compensator

This repository contains the implementation of a **multi-channel post-processing module** based on the [RDN (Residual Dense Network)](https://github.com/yjn870/RDN-pytorch).  
It is designed to compensate for compression-induced distortions in intermediate feature maps for machine vision tasks.

## Features

- Adapted RDN model to support multi-channel input/output.
- Designed specifically for post-processing in **Feature Coding for Machine (FCM)** pipelines.
- Compatible with PyTorch.

## Usage

Coming soon (add your usage instructions here).
